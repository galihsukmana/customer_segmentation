## Introduction
In this project, I performed credit card customer segmentation using unsupervised learning algorithms. The goal was to discover meaningful patterns and segments within the customer base, enabling personalized marketing strategies, targeted offers, and improved customer satisfaction.

I applied a K-Means clustering techniques, to group customers based on their credit card usage patterns, transaction and other relevant features. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor their products and services to specific customer needs and preferences.

## Dataset
The clustering analysis was performed on a credit card customer dataset sourced from h(8dsft_P1G4_galih_s.csv). The dataset contains various attributes such as credit card usage information and transaction history, etc. To access the dataset and reproduce the analysis, please follow the instructions provided in this repository.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:galihsukmana/customer_segmentation.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To perform credit card customer segmentation using the trained models, follow these steps:
1. Load the preprocessed dataset
2. Apply the clustering algorithm of your choice
3. Analyze and interpret the resulting customer segments


## Results
The credit card customer segmentation analysis resulting 3 cluster of customer segmentation. By clustering customers into distinct segments, businesses can better understand their customer base, target specific segments with tailored marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.
